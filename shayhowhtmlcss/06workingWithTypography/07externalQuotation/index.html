        <p>&#8220;In most people&#8217;s vocabularies, design is a veneer. It&#8217;s interior decorating. It&#8217;s the fabric of the curtains, of the sofa. But to me, nothing could be further from the meaning of design. Design is the fundamental soul of a human-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product.&#8221;</p>
