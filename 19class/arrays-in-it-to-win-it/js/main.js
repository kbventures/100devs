//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.

const movies = ['test','test2','supposed to be movies']

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable

const thisVariable = movies[0];

//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable

const thisOtherVarible = movies.length

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?


const thisNewVaribles = movies[thisOtherVarible -1];
